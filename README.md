This is a simple application for viewing Minecraft maps.  The default view is that
of the most recently played world, centered on the player location.  The window
can be panned and zoomed with the mouse.  Press `r` to re-render the map in the
background.  If the window is reactivated, it will re-center on the player location.

Possible future enhancements including selecting the world from a list, and providing
a way to save points of interest.
